## Firebase Security Rules üîí
Example security rules to restrict access to user-specific data:

```javascript
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId}/favorites/{recipeId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    match /recipes/{recipeId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```
